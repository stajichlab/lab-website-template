Congratulations to Talieh Ostovar who defended her PhD on June 28, 2024 on her project focused on plant comparative genomics in the genus *Boechera* as well as a project on the Citrus genome with our lab. Dr Ostovar was primarily advised by Liz Waters at SDSU but was co-advised in our lab through the UCR-EEOB Joint Doctoral Program with SDSU.
