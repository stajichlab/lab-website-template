Dr Claudia Coleine has been a collaborating member of the Stajich Lab since 2016 and will join the group as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie postdoc in early 2023 to work on endolithic microbes from drylands. Her research spans fungi and microbes from extreme cold and/or dry environments from Antarctica to the Arctic.
